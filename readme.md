**Overview**  
This program, created for DS210 is specifically designed to calculate and perform analysis on a dataset using a custom K-Means algorithm.  
I intended and hoped that clustering would allow for the dataset to demonstrate correlation specifically with fraud, assuming that clusters would demonstrate fraud rings and thus allow me to target fraud accurately.  
This is not the case however.  

**Notes:**  
Please use cargo run --release, as the data tends to load slowly without it.
